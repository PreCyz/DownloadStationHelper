# DownloadStationHelper

Application is useful for people who are lazy like me and do not want to manually create torrent tasks.

I use it to download new torrent task and save them, on my DiskStation (DS). On DS there is app Download Station, which scans 
that folder and creates new task when find new torrent file in folder.

Program checks if new task to create are available. Task is a torrent file. Torrents are located on one of the portals. 
The configuration and its description is located in application.properties. 
Names of torrent files to look for are located in shows.properties.
